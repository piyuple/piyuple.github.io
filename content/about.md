My name is Piyush and I'm a Machine Learning Engineer.

I love to understand how things actually work, not just using them, but really *getting* them. Mathematics isn't just a tool for me; it's a lens for seeing patterns in everything from machine learning to music to the way assembly code flows.

This blog is where I think out loud about the things I'm working on and learning. If something here clicks with you, reach out.


### Mathematics & Computation
---

There's this moment when you realize numbers aren't just a line. They're a plane. Negative numbers aren't just "backwards" but we can rotate into entirely different dimensions. The complex plane turned my understanding of mathematics sideways (literally), and Euler's identity captures why I find this so compelling:

$$e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0$$

Five fundamental constants in one elegant equation.

This same mindset carries into my work. I don't just want to know that a neural network converges. I want to understand the gradient flow. I don't just tokenize text for an LLM. I think about the linguistic structures being carved up and reassembled.


### Building Things
---

**Data Science**: I work with PyTorch, building models and actually understanding the mathematics underneath. The "why" matters as much as the "how".

**Game Development**: This is where math becomes art. Physics simulations, shader programming, sprite design, procedural audio. It's a creative playground that happens to be built on linear algebra and signal processing.


### Solving Puzzles
---

My brain likes patterns. Algorithmic problems, sudoku, strategy games like chess and backgammon. These scratch the same itch. There's something satisfying about finding the elegant solution hiding in complexity.


### Outside the Terminal
---

I run. Long distances, usually on weekends with friends. There's something meditative about it. The rhythm, the endurance, the mental clarity that comes around kilometre 16.

I read fiction when I can. Dostoevsky's psychological depth, Herbert's world-building, Heller's absurdism, Liu Cixin's cosmic perspective. I'm drawn to stories that make me think differently.


### What Drives Me
---

Curiosity. The desire to automate the tedious so there's more time for the interesting. The belief that understanding fundamentals unlocks creativity at higher levels.

I like when disciplines overlap. When mathematics illuminates music, when game design teaches you about human psychology, when a long run clears your head enough to solve a coding problem you've been stuck on.
